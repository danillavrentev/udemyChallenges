//  Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
//  calculated using the formula:
//  BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
//  and height in meter).
//  Your tasks:
//  1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
//  2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
//  versions)
//  3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
//  whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
//  Test data:
//  ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
// m tall.
//  ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
// m tall.

// 1 Data

const BMIJohn = weightJohn/heightJohn **2

console.log(BMIMark, BMIJohn);
